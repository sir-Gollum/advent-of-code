# advent-of-code

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is a great idea of an advent calendar for programmers. 
I've been playing it every year for the last few years. 
I never tried to finish puzzles on the day they open or make quick solutions to get into the 
leaderboard (I'm also not in a very convenient timezone for that); 
instead, I typically learn a trick or three every year.

It's just a nice collection of X-Mas themed programming challenges, and 
if you're looking at this repo, you probably should try it some time :)
